        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "   - Function: A function is a standalone block of code defined independently, and it is called directly by its name. It can accept arguments and may return a value. Example:  def add(x, y): return x + y result = add(5, 3)  # Calling the function, print(result) # Output: 8\n",
        "   - Method: A method is a function associated with an object or a class. Example:  def __init__(self, name): self.name = name\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "    - In Python, functions can accept inputs, known as arguments, which are passed into the function when it is called.Parameters act as placeholders for the values that will be passed as arguments.\n",
        "    - Example: def greet(name): # name is a parametervprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\" greet(\"Bob\")   # \"Bob\" is an argument\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, functions can be defined and called in several ways:\n",
        "   1. Standard Function Definition:\n",
        "This is the most common way to define a function, using the def keyword. Example-def greet(name):\n",
        "   2. Lambda Functions: Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.Example: add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "   - The return statement in Python serves to conclude the execution of a function and optionally transmit a value back to the caller. Example: def add(x, y): return x + y result = add(5, 3) print(result) # Output: 8\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "   - In Python, an iterator is an object that provides a way to iterate through a sequence of values one at a time, while an iterable is an object that can be looped over.\n",
        "   - Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # This is an iterable, my_iterator = iter(my_list)  # Create an iterator from the list\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "   - generator function allows you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, providing a faster and easier way to create iterators.Generator functions are written using the function* syntax.\n",
        "   - Example: def simple_generator(): yield 1 yield 2\n",
        "7.  What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "   - Generators have several advantages over regular functions, including memory efficiency, speed, and the ability to create infinite sequences.\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "   - A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function that's used for short-term tasks.\n",
        "   - When to use:\n",
        "To simplify short-term tasks, to streamline code with higher-order functions like map, filter, or sorted.\n",
        "9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "   - Map in Python is a function that works as an iterator to return a result after applying a function to every item of an iterable (tuple, lists, etc.)\n",
        "   - Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers) print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "   - map(): Applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator that yields the results. It transforms each element of the iterable. Example: umbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers) print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "   - filter(): Creates an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True. It selects elements based on a condition. Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers) print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
        "   - reduce(): Applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value. It aggregates elements. Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers) print(product)  # Output: 24\n",
        "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n",
        "list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
